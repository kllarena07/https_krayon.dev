# Kieran Llarena's Portfolio

## ✍ About

This is the code repository for my portfolio, specifically the browser version of it.

You can visit it at https://krayon.dev.

To view the terminal version, `ssh krayon.dev` (use in a modern terminal for the best experience). View the code [here](https://github.com/kllarena07/ssh_krayon.dev).

The way that the browser version works is just by spinning up a [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) Docker container, copy in the TUI binary, and run the binary in a ttyd environment in a restricted shell.
